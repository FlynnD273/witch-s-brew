solephanie: Oh my goodness hi. This place is absolutely adorable. So nice to get away from it all. My plate is absolutely filled with royal banquets to plan, foreign ambassadors to meet with, courts to hold. Such a busy schedule. Anyway, I have never been to a, what is it called, café. I’ll have whatever you think would be good.
