You enter your shop, it’s still dusty, but you’ve managed to get most of your grandmother’s stuff stored in the back. It was really so nice of her to offer her pocket dimension for your café. It is so convenient to be able to access it from anywhere.
As you are getting close to the end of your many repairs and additions to the space, you hear a small tinkling of a bell as the front door opens.

A figure you recognize stands beneath the frame. It’s Koaraok! A lifelong friend of your grandmother’s and experienced witch. He regards you warmly with a gentle smile beneath his large hat.
koaraok: Mmm[lspeed=0.1]...[lspeed] Breviaa’s workshop. Open once again. And a witch’s cafe is certainly a worthy use of such an accessible dimension. I daresay you’ve outdone your grandmother already, little witchlet.
koaraok: You’re using the same cauldron as your grandmother, no? Excellent. I am well-versed in potion mixing if you’d like a hand?
