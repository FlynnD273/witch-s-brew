solephanie: Hi again! I just wanted to thank you again for these wonderful brews. I have been able to take time to relax and get some of my work done. I spoke with Darnery and we have reached an agreement.
darnery: I shall escort the princess on her outings. We have grown to understand that time outside the castle can be good, as long as I am there in instances where I am needed.
solephanie: Yes! So you will  be seeing more of us both! Isn’t it wonderful?! Anyway, I’ll have one of those wonderful brews now, if you don’t mind.
